# unicodevoyager

My goals with this project are to present the organization of Unicode intuitively and to explain at least the basic principles of the writing systems Unicode encodes. Since there are so many ways these goals could be visualized, I'm going to try a lot of different formats! I also have plenty to learn and review myself as I work on it.
